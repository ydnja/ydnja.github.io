      <h5 style="text-align: center">Immigration and Europe</h5>
        <p>Europe faced a wave of migration during the European Migrant Crisis, and now, the War in Ukraine.
           <br>Countries that accepted many refugees are some of the oldest countries in the world by average population age: Germany, Italy, Greece and Spain etc.
           <br>Eastern European countries like Latvia and Lithuania, and Romania are expected to see the largest reductions in population by 2100, as much as 43.7% for Latvia
           <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?oldid=497115#An_ageing_society" style = "color:#ffffff"><sup>[1]</sup></a>
           <br>Immigration has served as a means of replenishing workforce in host countries,
            <br>however, their labor market performance vary widely depending on their education, and reason for migration.<br>
        <h5 style="text-align: center">Issues an aging society faces</h5>
          <p>Many European nations rely on income and consumption taxes to fund the extensive welfare programmes designed to help its citizens. <br>
          With an aging population, the number in the workforce will shrink, and dependent population will rise (those younger than 15, older than 65)<br>
          A shrinking working population results in lower tax revenue, thus, reducing the ability of a nation to fund welfare programmes in a sustainable manner.<br>
          It is tempting to incentivize people to have children, but these children will not begin working for at least another 15 years.</p>
        <h5 style = "text-align: center">Immigration offers a temorary solution, if done correctly</h5>
           <p>In this paper, I attempt to answer the question about immigration status, and education in the European Union, using microdata from EQLS 2016,
           <br>with information on household income, EU-birth status, immigration status, and education status.
         </p>

        <h5 style = "text-align: center">Issue with original paper: Did not account for survey weights</h5>
        <p>Original paper did not take survey weights into consideration, thus, results are inaccurate. <br>
          Paper is currently being revised to take survey weights into account.</p>
